This master thesis presents a quadrature free implementation of the discontinuous Galerkin
(DG) method for two–dimensional hyperbolic equations. It can be used as a template for code
generators or embedding it in distributed frameworks as a DG–solver on local grids. To minimize
the computational costs, a quadrature free integration is used for assembling the linear system of
equations. Particular attention was paid to keep the code as simple as possible to ensure that it
is straight forward to apply different performance optimization and parallelization techniques.
On the other hand, the code is still flexible to stay suitable for many use cases and applications.
The implementation supports higher order spatial approximation as well as disturbed meshes.
The data structures and kernels are designed such that they are easily embedded in a distributed
framework and single node OpenMP parallelization can be simply added.
